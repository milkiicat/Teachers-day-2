# Teachers-day-2

Whatever witty retort the students had, Mr Lim had one better. He took their disobedience and turned it into an advantage for himself, but not through belittling them or constant nagging. He changed their behaviour with a style of humour they could relate to, talking in different accents and causing the students to immediately crack up into loud laughter.

He was a teacher who would try his best to keep the class entertained and awake throughout the lessons, talking in a louder tone to wake the sleepy students indirectly. He was a teacher who would teach us lessons other than academics, he thought us ways to lessen post-exam anxiety through simple breathing exercises or encouraging us through little actions such as buying some snacks for us as prizes. He was someone who did not just focus on the usual mundane routine of teaching, but trying his best to cultivate a optimistic way of studying in his students, helping the class in ways they could have never imagined in the future.
